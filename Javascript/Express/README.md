**IMPORTANT: THE EXPRESS.JS IMPLEMENTATION USES A DEPRECEATED NODEJS PACKAGE(REQUEST), THIS IS MEANT TO BE FOR SHOWCASE ONLY. FOR ACTUALLY DOING IT, USE AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE REQUEST LIBRARY IF YOU WANT TO USE IT IN PRODUCTION**

The following files in the directory lead to the Express.js implementation of avPass, which only returns the basic details of a user account, requiring a lot more tweaking and a authentication framework being needed to fit your needs.

**TO GET STARTED:**

Install the packages and fill in the details, then go to the /auth route at localhost:3000/auth, and you are all set!
